  ChainForensics is a privacy-focused Bitcoin blockchain analysis tool that runs 
  entirely on your own node.


  FEATURES:

  • Transaction Analysis - View complete transaction details, inputs, outputs, and fees

  • UTXO Tracing - Follow the money trail forward or backward through the blockchain

  • CoinJoin Detection - Identify Whirlpool, Wasabi, and JoinMarket transactions

  • Privacy Scoring - Rate how private your UTXOs are

  • KYC Privacy Check - See if your exchange withdrawal can be traced to your current holdings

  • Dust Attack Detection - Find suspicious tiny UTXOs that may be tracking attempts

  • Address Lookup - Check balances and UTXOs for any address (requires Electrs)


  PRIVACY FIRST:

  All analysis runs locally on your node. No external servers, no tracking, no data leaves your network.


  REQUIREMENTS:

  • Bitcoin Node (required) - Must have txindex=1 enabled

  • Electrs (highly recommended) - Required for address lookups, balance checking, dust detection, and forward UTXO tracing. Install Electrs first for full functionality!
