description: >-
  ChainForensics is a privacy-focused Bitcoin blockchain analysis tool that runs 
  entirely on your own node.


  FEATURES:

  • Transaction Analysis - View complete transaction details, inputs, outputs, and fees

  • UTXO Tracing - Follow the money trail forward or backward through the blockchain

  • CoinJoin Detection - Identify Whirlpool, Wasabi, and JoinMarket transactions

  • Privacy Scoring - Rate how private your UTXOs are

  • KYC Privacy Check - See if your exchange withdrawal can be traced to your current holdings

  • Dust Attack Detection - Find suspicious tiny UTXOs that may be tracking attempts

  • Address Lookup - Check balances and UTXOs for any address (requires Electrs)


  PRIVACY FIRST:

  All analysis runs locally on your node. No external servers, no tracking, no data leaves your network.


  REQUIREMENTS:

  • Bitcoin Node (required) - Must have txindex=1 enabled

  • Electrs (highly recommended) - Required for address lookups, balance checking, dust detection, and forward UTXO tracing. Install Electrs first for full functionality!

releaseNotes: >-
  v1.2.0 - Fixed critical Electrs 'verbose mode' bug. Detected that Electrs sometimes 
  returns non-verbose responses (only height/hex) when verbose=True is requested. 
  Now auto-detects this broken state, forces reconnection, and retries. Health check 
  now probes actual transaction fetching to detect degraded state. UI shows "Degraded" 
  status with warning when Electrs verbose mode fails. Added diagnostic endpoint 
  /api/v1/electrs-test/{txid} for troubleshooting.
